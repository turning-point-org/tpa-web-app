## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- **Volumetric Data Management**: Comprehensive volumetric metrics system for process groups and categories
  - **Process Group Creation**: Enhanced "Create New Process Group" modal with volumetric data input fields
    - Average Handling Time (AHT) with unit selection (Minutes, Hours, Days)
    - Cycle Time with unit selection (Minutes, Hours, Days)
    - Headcount with positive integer validation
    - Cost with positive integer validation and dollar formatting
  - **Process Group Editing**: Updated "Edit Process Group" modal with full volumetric data editing capabilities
  - **Automatic Base Minutes Calculation**: Real-time conversion of time units to standardized base_minutes
    - Minutes: `base_minutes = value`
    - Hours: `base_minutes = value * 60`
    - Days: `base_minutes = value * 60 * 24`
  - **Category-Level Aggregation**: New calculation functions for process categories
    - `calculateCategoryHeadcount()`: Sums headcount across all process groups in a category
    - `calculateCategoryCost()`: Sums cost across all process groups in a category

    - Metrics hidden by default, controllable via menu dropdown
    - Independent visibility control for scores vs. volumetric metrics

### Enhanced

- **Input Field Clearing**: Addressed issue where default '0' values in volumetric input fields could not be removed
  - Implemented separate display state for input fields to allow visual clearing while maintaining numeric data state
  - Applied fix to both "Create New Process Group" and "Edit Process Group" modals

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- **Horizontal Overflow Issue**: Resolved critical layout issue where the LifecycleViewer component would extend beyond the viewport width when multiple process category cards were added
  - Fixed `MainContent.tsx`: Added `overflow-x-hidden` and `max-w-full` to the main content area to prevent horizontal expansion
  - Fixed `page.tsx` (lifecycle detail page): Added width constraints (`w-full max-w-full overflow-hidden`) to parent container
  - Fixed `LifecycleViewer.tsx`: 
    - Added `w-full max-w-full` constraints to outer containers
    - Wrapped TransformWrapper in a constrained div with `overflow-hidden` and fixed height
    - Updated TransformComponent contentStyle to use `inline-flex` with `flex-start` alignment instead of forcing full width
    - This allows users to pan/zoom to view all category cards without causing page-wide horizontal scrolling

### Technical Details
- Implemented multiple layers of overflow protection at different component levels
- Maintained zoom/pan functionality while preventing viewport overflow
- Solution is responsive and works across different screen sizes
- Fixed width remains consistent regardless of the number of process categories added
